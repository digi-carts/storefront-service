### Added
- `GET /health` and `GET /api/health` liveness JSON (`status` + `service`)
- JavaDoc on public types, `package-info.java`, and the Maven javadoc plugin
- JUnit 5 unit tests and Cucumber component features (Cucumber is excluded from the Maven Surefire unit-test run)
- GitHub Actions `pr-tests.yml`: pull requests to `stage`/`main` run `mvn -B test` and fail the check on failure
- Dev deploy (`deploy-dev.yml`) now runs the same unit tests and deploys only if they pass
